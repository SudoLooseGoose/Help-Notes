# Syntax

**Downloading**
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I found this one on accident. What I was trying to do was just link to a different page but instead of linking me to the next page it would automatically download the file. After a while I noticed that there was a space that there was a space between file name with extension and the closing bracket. I believe that the space is key on making automatic trigger happen.


**Indentation**

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Add as make of `&nbsp`, for how many spaces you want.
